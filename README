1. To deploy the webapp, build the project using command "mvn clean install".This will generate a deployable WAR file.
    (WAR file is already in the repo, you can directly use it). Put this WAR file in your local TOMCAT server's webapps folder
    and extract it into folder "basciapp"(This basicapp will be the context of the app). After this start the TOMCAT server.
    
2. Opne a rest-client like POSTMAN to test the APIs.

3. Data is persisted in-memory, so initially there are no products and categories.

4. To call API endpoints for create or update or delete of product/category, you have to fetch the "JWT" token first.
    Make a call to "localhost:<port>/basicapp/api/oauth/token" endpoint with client_id="qwerty" and cliend_secret="Secure22" and 
    this content will be of type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". After getting the token, add this to authorization header
    as "Bearer <token>". example "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImprdSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd2Fhc3"

5. To create a category, make a POST call to "basicapp/api/create/category" endpoint with body as:
            ```
            {"categoryName":"C2"}
            ```
